### Incident Details
**Date:** January 2, 2025  
**Time:** 2:45 PM  
**Location:** Main Brewing Floor, Hops Hopper #3  

---

### Description of Incident
While conducting my routine safety inspection (and a quick taste test), I noticed that Hopper #3 was making an unusual clunking noise, which is not the usual cheerful clunking sound we all love. Upon closer investigation, it became clear that the hopper had become jammed. Before I could stop production, the pressure built up, causing a burst of hops to spray across the floor and onto several employees, myself included.

No one was injured, but the incident did create a temporary slip hazard and a distinct "hoppy" aroma that lingered for the rest of the day.

### Immediate Actions Taken
1. Alerted production staff to stop Hopper #3 immediately.  
2. Secured the area to prevent further slip hazards.  
3. Gathered the team for a quick cleanup using industrial mops (and a surprisingly absorbent beach towel I found in the breakroom).  
4. Called maintenance to inspect the hopper and identify the cause of the jam.

### Cause of Incident
After a thorough investigation, it was determined that the jam was caused by an overzealous addition of hops during the brewing process. As I suspected, enthusiasm for creating the next great Pawtucket beer may have gotten the better of one of our brewers (no names, but we all know who it was).

### Recommendations
To prevent future incidents:

1. Implement stricter guidelines for the amount of hops added per batch. 
2. Conduct regular maintenance checks on all hoppers.  
3. Provide additional training for staff on proper brewing techniques and the dangers of “too much of a good thing.”  
4. Keep an extra supply of industrial-strength mops on hand.

### Conclusion
While the incident caused a brief disruption, it highlighted the importance of vigilance and teamwork. I’m confident that by following these recommendations, we can avoid similar "hop-tastrophes" in the future. As always, safety first—unless there's beer involved. Then safety *and* beer first.

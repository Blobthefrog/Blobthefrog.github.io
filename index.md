### Welcome

I am a biology major at Southern New Hampshire University working towards getting my bachelorâ€™s degree in December of 2025. I currently work at NHSportsDome where I help operate an indoor soccer field for people to play various sports such as soccer, baseball, softball, lacrosse, hurling etc.... I also work at Southern New Hampshires University commuter lounge where I help to create a space that is welcoming to all students at the University and planning events.

During my time at Southern New Hampshire University I have worked on projects such as the chytrid fungus project where we catch frogs to test them for the fungus. I have also worked with the office of sustainability to make the campus a more ecofriendly environment.

You can veiw my bee colonly anlysis here. In this analysis I looked at and compared the number of bee colonies lost to the time of year they were lost.
